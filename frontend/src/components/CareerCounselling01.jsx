          whichever stream you opt for career planning is essential through
          expert career counselling. Factors like self-efficiency, satisfaction,
          happiness are co-related to job satisfaction, therefore career
          counselling becomes more important than any other form of counselling.
          Career counselling and guidance is required on the part of students
          due to ignorance of personal abilities and potentials, parental
          pressure and multiple career options which may create a confusion in
          their minds.
